        <p class="texte-article">
            The eternal hope of French football, Hatem Ben Arfa has unfortunately never missed an opportunity to make a bad decision concerning his career and has never been able to exploit his immense talent for football. His very questionable career decisions and spoiled only child behaviour, especially at a very critical time in a footballer's short career, have spoiled the rendering of this talented footballer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">
            Everyone agrees that Hatemn is a mad talent. Everyone also agrees that he has a head of steam unable to listen to the advice of older people and above all never respecting the hierarchy within a structure that is obedient and requires respect for the organisation such as within a club
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sous-titre-article">His background</h2>

        <p class="texte-article">
            Hatem stayed with Lyon for four years before joining Olympique de Marseille in the summer of 2008. This departure was 
            after a series of challenges to the decisions of his coach Gérard Houiller and his president 
            Jean-Michel Aulas. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">
            At first, Lyon refused to let him leave, but Ben Arfa opposed his parent club and lobbied to leave Lyon. 
            to leave the club in Lyon.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">
            And even after 5 years in England, neither the relevance of his choices and decisions, nor his behaviour
            have changed !
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">And as his ex-teammate Karim Benzema said, who compared him to Lionel Messi but his career choices and behaviour had partly spoiled his potential.
            his career choices and behaviour had largely wasted his potential.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">Where did it all go wrong for Hatem Ben Arfa? For those close to him, it was in his childhood that 
            something went wrong. He was the king. He was always told his rights but never his duties. 
            He could easily have been a future Ballon d'Or winner because he was so talented. It will remain a huge 
            It will remain a huge waste, it's perhaps the waste of football in the 21st century."
