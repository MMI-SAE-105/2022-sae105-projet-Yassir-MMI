            The child prodigy, a French player from the club AS Bondy in the Paris region. Kylian Mbappé was born on 20 December 1998 in Paris and will continue his development as a striker.

        <h2 class="sous-titre-article">Mbappé, a new French talent...  </h2>

        <p class="texte-article">
            This work allows us to know more about this French phenomenon who quickly placed himself at the forefront of the international scene. It explains in detail the path taken by this player and the values that forged him. 
            Mbappé started playing football at a very early age as his father was a trainer in a sports association in Bondy, so he started with AS Bondy in 2004, then joined the training centre set up by the AS Monaco Club in Ligue 1. A few years later, Kylian made his debut in Ligue 1 and became the youngest player to wear the AS Monaco shirt, just ahead of Thierry Henry.

        <h2 class="sous-titre-article">His impressive entry into the 2017 Mercato</h2>

        <p class="texte-article">
            As soon as he arrived, he started to be noticed in the French championship, in 2016 AS Monaco refused an offer of 40 million euros from the very famous Manchester City Club. And the young Mbappé after a long reflection between the offers of PSG, Real Madrid and Manchester City, he is finally transferred to Paris Saint Germain under the contract of a loan with option to buy for 180 million euros, during the last day of the mercato after some contradictory media announcements in 2017. He will continue his journey with Paris Saint Germain and will not cease to impress big names in international football by overcoming all the barriers linked to his young age.
