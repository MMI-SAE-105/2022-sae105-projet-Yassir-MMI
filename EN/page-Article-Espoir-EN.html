            And as the saying goes, numbers don't lie. Kylian Mbappé has smashed all footballing figures since he first stepped into the shoes of the Ligue 1, which he joined at the age of 16.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">
            Already considered an overachiever by his college teachers, Killian won the 2018 World Cup in Russia. At nineteen, he is the second youngest player after King Pele to score a brace in the finals of the same Cup and was named the best young player of the competition by FIFA during the World Cup.
            At 21, Killian is the youngest player to score 100 goals in the professional league. And the icing on the cake, he will be the best paid player in the world during the 2022-2023 season, pocketing 125 million euros.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="sous-titre-article">How did it come to this?</h2>

        <p class="texte-article">
            The social and family environment in which Kylian Mbappé was raised does not explain everything. But it is certain that he was physically and intellectually predisposed to rise to the top of the footballing world. The choices he made regarding his commitment to play in a particular team and the management of his career show a certain early maturity in this young footballer. His sporting family environment has certainly contributed to this meteoric rise.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">
            For the moment, Kylian Mbappé does not have too many competitors for the position he occupies in the national team. This fact can cause any youngster of his age to slacken off. And despite this risk, sports analysts and critics are unanimous that his closest family circle and his ability to absorb external pressures allow him to move forward without hesitation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="texte-article">
            We are on the eve of the great football event of the World Cup in Qatar. It will be another test for this young phenomenon of world football.
